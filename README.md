# apexcify_profile_page

A new Flutter project showcasing a clean and well-structured user profile page layout.

Overview:
This application serves as a demonstration of fundamental Flutter UI principles, specifically focusing on the presentation of user data using core widgets. The main goal is to provide a visually appealing and organized profile view.

Features and Design Highlights

Profile Identity: Displays the user's photo using CircleAvatar and primary contact details prominently at the top.
Highlighted Bio: A dedicated Container is used to frame a professional summary, setting it apart from other data fields.
Structured Information: Utilizes ListTile widgets to present secondary details (Username, full Email, Bio description) in an organized, readable list format, each paired with a relevant icon.
Action Button: Includes a FloatingActionButton with an edit icon, which serves as a visual placeholder for the profile editing functionality (the editing logic is not implemented).
